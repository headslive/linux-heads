FORE Systems PCA-200E/SBA-200E ATM NIC driver
---------------------------------------------

This driver adds support for the FORE Systems 200E-series ATM adapters
to the Linux operating system. It is based on the earlier PCA-200E driver
written by Uwe Dannowski.

The driver simultaneously supports PCA-200E and SBA-200E adapters on
i386, alpha (untested), powerpc, sparc and sparc64 archs.

The intent is to enable the use of different models of FORE adapters at the
same time, by hosts that have several bus interfaces (such as PCI+SBUS,
or PCI+EISA).

Only PCI and SBUS devices are currently supported by the driver, but support
for other bus interfaces such as EISA should not be too hard to add.
